# ML Matching API

Deployed API link: https://algorithm-api-wy7g.onrender.com/

This service implements an influencer-brand matching engine using weighted cosine similarity. It currently supports Facebook, with the intention of including YouTube and TikTok vectors (configurable via the `platform` field).

- Dockerfile: Builds a Python container running the FastAPI app.
- docker-compose.yml: Brings up the API service on port 8000.
- requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies.
- load_test_data.py: Inserts sample influencer vectors into MongoDB.
- README.txt: This guide.
- matching/: Contains the core Python modules:
  - algorithm.py: weighted_cosine_similarity logic.
  - database.py: MongoDB connection and platform-based fetch.
  - main.py: FastAPI app exposing the /match endpoint.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- MongoDB cluster with a `metrics` database and collections named `Facebook`, `YouTube`, and `TikTok`.
